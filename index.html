				<h1>About the Donut: The Sweet Truth</h1>
				<p class="p-3 text-lg bg-black/10 backdrop-blur-sm">
					What if the moon wasn’t the only thing up there? What if, hiding in
					plain sight, there was a massive, rotating donut orbiting Earth? This
					isn’t just a fantasy, it’s the Donut Earth Theory!
				</p>
				<p class="p-3 text-lg bg-black/10 backdrop-blur-sm">
					Legend has it that the donut was baked by an ancient civilization with
					an advanced understanding of pastry and planetary motion. Over
					millennia, it has remained hidden from the naked eye, visible only to
					those who believe.

					Experts believe that the donut’s rotation is powered by cosmic forces,
					possibly dark chocolate energy. Its rotation keeps it stable,
					preventing it from falling apart under the weight of its
					deliciousness.
